LAUNCHING REDIS ON UBUNTU
USE FOLLOWING COMMANDS

Step 1: Install Redis
	1. Start by updating the package repository:

	sudo apt update

	2. Then, install Redis with the command:

	sudo apt install redis-server

Step 2: Configure Redis

	1. Once the installation is complete, modify the Redis configuration file. To do so, open the file with a 		text editor of your choice (we are using nano):

	sudo nano /etc/redis/redis.conf

	2. Next, find the line specifying the supervised directive. By default, this line is set to no. However, to 		manage Redis as a service, set the supervised directive to systemd (Ubuntuâ€™s init system).

	3. Save the changes and close the file.

	4. Finally, restart the Redis service by running:

	sudo systemctl restart redis.service
